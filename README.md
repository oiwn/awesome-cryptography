# Awesome Cryptography!

Curated list of awesome cryptography projects, libraries, and resources.

## Papers

[Cryptology ePrint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org) - provides rapid access to recent research in cryptology. Papers have been placed here by the authors and did not undergo any refereeing process other than verifying that the work seems to be within the scope of cryptology and meets some minimal acceptance criteria and publishing conditions.

## Rust fundamentals

+ [algebra](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra) - libraries for finite field, elliptic curve, and polynomial arithmetic

## Distributed

+ http://ipfs.io - The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

## Homomorphic Encryption

* [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) - Open-source library for fully homomorphic encryption, supporting multiple schemes including CKKS, BGV, and BFV.
* [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL) - easy-to-use and powerful homomorphic encryption library.
* [HEXL](https://github.com/IntelLabs/hexl) - Intel Homomorphic Encryption Acceleration Library accelerates modular arithmetic operations used in homomorphic encryption by leveraging AVX512 and IFM52 available on Intel's 3rd Generation Xeon Scalable Processors and later.


## Oracles

* [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) - Decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely interact with off-chain data and external APIs.
