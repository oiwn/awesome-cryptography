# Awesome Cryptography!

Curated list of awesome cryptography projects, libraries, and resources.


## Distributed

+ http://ipfs.io - The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
+ https://www.bigchaindb.com - a decentralized database, at scale. It is complementary to decentralized processing platforms like Ethereum, and decentralized file systems like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
