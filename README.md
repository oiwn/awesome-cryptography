# Awesome FHE Cryptography!

Curated list of awesome Fully Homomorphic Encryption projects, libraries, and resources.

## Books

[Begginers book](https://fhetextbook.github.io) - The Beginner’s Textbook for Fully Homomorphic Encryption

## Papers

[Cryptology ePrint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org) - provides rapid access to recent research in cryptology. Papers have been placed here by the authors and did not undergo any refereeing process other than verifying that the work seems to be within the scope of cryptology and meets some minimal acceptance criteria and publishing conditions.

## Rust fundamentals

+ [algebra](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra) - libraries for finite field, elliptic curve, and polynomial arithmetic
+ [crypto-bigint](https://github.com/RustCrypto/crypto-bigint) - Cryptography-oriented big integer library with constant-time, stack-allocated (no_std-friendly) implementations of modern formulas

## FHE frameworks

* [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) - Open-source library for fully homomorphic encryption, supporting multiple schemes including CKKS, BGV, and BFV.
* [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL) - easy-to-use and powerful homomorphic encryption library.
* [HEXL](https://github.com/IntelLabs/hexl) - Intel Homomorphic Encryption Acceleration Library accelerates modular arithmetic operations used in homomorphic encryption by leveraging AVX512 and IFM52 available on Intel's 3rd Generation Xeon Scalable Processors and later.
* [Lattigo](https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo) - A library for lattice-based multiparty homomorphic encryption in Go.
* [fhe.rs](https://github.com/tlepoint/fhe.rs) - Fully Homomorphic Encryption library in Rust: RNS-variant of the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV)
